# Reinforcement learning for civilization like game

# Game
Game is a simple civilization simulator including: 
- 2 types of units: Settler which can move one field at turn along with ability to build cities, and Scout that moves 2 fields per turn
- 3 kinds of cities: basic, wood and iron. Each kind of city generates diffrent amount of gold per turn
- Resources: gold, wood, iron

# Reinforcement learning
Q-learning algorithm for maximalization of gold amount at the end of 25th turn.
